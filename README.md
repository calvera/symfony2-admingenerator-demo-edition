Symfony2 Admingenerator Demo Edition
========================

This repository holds a fully functional Symfony2 application
with pre-configured Admingenerator dependencies and demo bundles
acting as a showcase of Admingenerator features.

> **Note:** These demo's depend on Admingenerator v2.0, which are
not yet stable, and so, this repo is also not yet stable.

> **Note:** The demos for Doctrine ODM and Propel ORM will be added,
as soon as Doctrine ORM will be stable.

> **Note:** Old (legacy) repositories and packagist names:
>
> * AdmingeneratorGeneratorBundle
>   github: `git@github.com:symfony2admingenerator/AdmingeneratorGeneratorBundle.git`
>   packagist: "cedriclombardot/admingenerator-generator-bundle"
>
> * AvocodeFormExtensionsBundle
>   github: `git@github.com:symfony2admingenerator/AvocodeFormExtensionsBundle.git`
>   packagist: "avocode/form-extensions-bundle"
>
> **Warning:** These repositories are left for legacy users and are **NOT COMPATIBLE** with this demo.

> **Note:** I'm aware that the documentation needs much improvement, please be patient, as soon
> as I get v2.0 stable I'll rewrite the whole docs.
